# johnceenamon
Johnceenamon is a discord bot that got made when I thought of Apple Jacks and John Cena at the same time and thought it was funny.

If you're trying to get Ceenamon to work, you should be able to run app.py after installing all of the require (pip install -r requirements.txt)

Ceenamon also needs to have your discord bots API token stored in the environment variable BOT_USER_TOKEN.

There are also mp3s that Ceenamon expects to be there, but in the interests of not distributing those, I'll leave you up to your own devices there.

Ceenamon is in development whenever I can find the time and interest to do it, but if you make the fateful decision to use the unstable product, do it at your own risk.


python basic_voice.py
